Web Scraping Project Using Python to Extract Data from Wikipedia

#  üìÖ Duration: June 2025

# üìÑ Description:

This project focused on building a Python-based web scraping tool to efficiently extract structured data from Wikipedia. The main objective was to automate the collection of business-related information such as:

* Company name
* Industry
* Rank
* Revenue (in USD millions)
* Revenue growth
* Employee count
* Headquarters location

Using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, I scraped the necessary data by targeting specific HTML elements. I then processed and structured the extracted data using pandas, making it ready for further analysis or visualization.

To avoid being blocked by the server, I also used custom headers to simulate browser behavior during the scraping process.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

* Python
* BeautifulSoup
* requests
* pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Website inspection via browser Developer Tools

This project enhanced my understanding of real-world web scraping, HTML parsing, and data wrangling using Python libraries. It also gave me practical experience in handling anti-scraping mechanisms like user-agent headers.
